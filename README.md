# BigDataProject

When you are a smart student, or a parent that want to give the
best education possible to your child, a question arises : How to
strive for excellence?
Excellence is a concept that could be defined as being on the top
tier category of what you are doing. In the case of education, this
means going to the best schools in their field, such as
Polytechnique School, HEC Paris or Sciences Po Paris.
There are two main ways to go to these schools: entrance
examination and selection on application file. In both of these
cases, being in a great high school will strongly increase your
ability to get in.
That's why if you want to strive for excellence, you need to choose
correctly your high school, and before your college to enter it.
Before the experiment, we will concentrate ourselves on three main
theories, and broaden on them to find some interesting correlations
that will help you to make your choice. These theories are:
- When a college is good, it tends to stay good across years, and
reciprocally
- Private colleges give a better education than public ones.
- The education is better in big cities than in small towns.
By using the data, we will try to give an answer to see if those
hypotheses are empirically true or not.

# Datasets used:
1. Data of results in the french DNB (Diplome National du Brevet) in year of 2018. This
dataset comes from data.gouv.fr and will be the basis of our study.
2. and
3. The same datasets from 2017 and 2019. They will be useful to give a time dimension of
the study.
4. A dataset of french municipalities also coming from data.gouv.fr, to compare results
depending on location.
5. A dataset of french departments and their geographical location, to do a map of results
grouped by department.
Note: The notebook refers to five datasets, but only four are included in this repository. This is due to the fact that the version of the project archived here predates the final delivery version, in which a fifth dataset was added during the last stage of the work. The analysis and conclusions remain consistent.
